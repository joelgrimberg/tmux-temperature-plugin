# Local Temperature

Local Temperature is a simple plugin that displays the 
temperature received from a temperature sensor in your Tmux status line

## Requirements

### An exposed API that returns a temperature

In essence, a curl request is being made and the returned
value is displayed in the Tmux status line

### Other dependencies

Make sure you have [Tmux Plugin Manager](https://github/tmux-plugins/tpm) 
and [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download) installed.
